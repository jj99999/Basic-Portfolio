			I love communications. I love technology.  Human language and communications are constantly changing and I love the way technology and the Internet have cranked this change up to warp speed.  I grew up in a newspaper family;  I still read several newspapers per day only now I read them on my smartphone.</p>

			<p>In college I studied English (because I love to read) and Journalism (see above). I spent five years in the Army bouncing around the world.  When I returned to civilian life I got an MBA and eventually landed in digital marketing, ecommerce,  digital engagement,  or whatever the buzzword of the moment is (remember what I said above about language constantly changing?). This led me to dig deeper into the technology that drives global communication and commerce. So here we are. More languages. More technology.  Coding.</p>
